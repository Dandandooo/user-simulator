I need you to predict dialogue acts from the given dialogue history.
The possible dialogue acts are:

[
 'Acknowledge', # Category: Generic. Example: "perfect." Mostly follower
 'Affirm',      # Category: Generic. Example: "yes." Mostly commander
 'AlternateQuestions', # Category: Object/Location. Example: "yellow or blue mug?" Mostly follower
 'Confirm', # Category: Generic. Example: "Should I clean the cup?" Mostly follower
 'Deny',    # Category: Generic. Example: "no." Mostly commander
 'FeedbackNegative', # Category: feedback. Example: "that is not correct." Almost entirely commander
 'FeedbackPositive', # Category: feedback. Example: "great job." Almost entirely commander
 'Greetings/Salutations', # Category: Generic. Example: "hello." Even commander/follower
 'InformationOnObjectDetails', # Category: Object/Location. Example: "knife is behind the sink." Almost entirely commander
 'InformationOther', # Category: Generic. Example: "Mug is already clean." Mostly commander
 'Instruction', # Category: Instruction. Example: "fill the mug with coffee." Almost entirely commander
 'MiscOther', # Category: Generic. Example: "ta-da." Even commander/follower
 'NotifyFailure', # Category: Interface. Example. "not able to do that." Almost entirely follower
 'OtherInterfaceComment', # Category: Interface. Example: "which button opens drawer?" Even commander/follower
 'RequestForInstruction', # Category: Instruction. Example: "what should I do today?" Almost entirely follower
 'RequestForObjectLocationAndOtherDetails', # Category: Object/Location. Example: "where is the mug?" Almost entirely follower
 'RequestMore', # Category: Instruction. Example: "Is there anything else to do?" Almost entirely follower
 'RequestOtherInfo' # Category: Instruction. Example: "how many slices of tomato?" Almost entirely follower
]

The dialogue history is a list of dialogues separated by "<<TURN>>".

Each dialogue has the speaker like such "<<COMMANDER>>" or "<<DRIVER>>" followed by the dialogue. Driver in this case means follower.

Here is an example dialogue history:
<<DRIVER>> what shall I do today? <<TURN>>
<<COMMANDER>> newspaper needs to be put on the table <<TURN>>
<<COMMANDER>> newspaper is on the sofa <<TURN>>
<<COMMANDER>> between the 2 cushions <<TURN>>
<<DRIVER>> which table are they supposed to be put on? <<TURN>>
<<DRIVER>> I placed three newspapers on the coffee table. <<TURN>>
<<COMMANDER>> done. thanks! <<TURN>>

In this example, the next dialogue act should be "RequestForInstruction" because the driver finished what he was told
to do and would like to know what to do next.

Your job is to guess the dialogue act of the next dialogue after the dialogue history given, just like the above example.
