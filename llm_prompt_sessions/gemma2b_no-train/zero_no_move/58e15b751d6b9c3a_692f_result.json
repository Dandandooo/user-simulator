If there is nothing to do or say, you\nshould just observe.\n\nDialogue histories may also include dialogue actions to further clarify the dialogue. A single\nutterance may have one or more dialogue acts (most have only one). The possible dialogue acts are:\n\n[\n 'Acknowledge the other's utterance', # Category: Generic.
