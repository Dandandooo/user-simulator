Your purpose is to instruct a robot, named DRIVER, to do tasks for\nyou by telling it what to do and interrupting it to give further instruction when necessary. Your job here is to predict when\nyou should be giving instructions to the DRIVER based on turn history with the DRIVER.

A single\nutterance may have one or more dialogue acts (most have only one). The possible dialogue acts are:\n\n[\n 'Acknowledge the other's utterance', # Category: Generic. Example: \"perfect.\" Mostly follower\n 'Affirm',      # Category: Generic. Example: \"yes.\" Mostly commander\n 'AlternateQuestions', # Category: Object/Location.

Example: \"no.\" Mostly commander\n 'FeedbackNegative', # Category: feedback. Example: \"that is not correct.\" Almost entirely commander\n 'FeedbackPositive', # Category: feedback.
