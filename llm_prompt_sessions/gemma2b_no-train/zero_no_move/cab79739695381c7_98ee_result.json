Your purpose is to instruct a robot, named DRIVER, to do tasks for\nyou by telling it what to do and interrupting it to give further instruction when necessary. Your job here is to predict when\nyou should be giving instructions to the DRIVER based on turn history with the DRIVER. If there is nothing to do or say, you\nshould just observe.\n\nDialogue histories may also include dialogue actions to further clarify the dialogue. A single\nutterance may have one or more dialogue acts (most have only one). The possible dialogue acts are:\n\n[\n 'Acknowledge the other's utterance', # Category: Generic. Example: \"perfect.\" Mostly follower\n 'Affirm',      # Category: Generic. Example: \"yes.\" Mostly commander\n 'AlternateQuestions', # Category: Object/Location. Example: \"yellow or blue mug?\" Mostly follower\n 'Confirm', # Category: Generic. Example: \"Should I clean the cup?\" Mostly follower\n 'Deny',    # Category: Generic. Example: \"no.\" Mostly commander\n 'FeedbackNegative', # Category: feedback. Example: \"that is not correct.\" Almost entirely commander\n 'FeedbackPositive', # Category: feedback. Example: \"great job.\" Almost entirely commander\n 'Greetings/Salutations', # Category: Generic. Example: \"hello.\" Even commander/follower\n 'InformationOnObjectDetails', # Category: Object/Location. Example: \"knife is behind the sink.\" Almost entirely commander\n 'InformationOther', # Category: Generic. Example: \"Mug is already clean.\" Mostly commander\n 'Instruction', # Category: Instruction. Example: \"fill the mug with coffee.\" Almost entirely commander\n 'MiscOther', # Category: Generic. Example: \"ta-da.\" Even commander/follower\n 'NotifyFailure', # Category: Interface. Example. \"not able to do that.\" Almost entirely follower\n 'OtherInterfaceComment', # Category: Interface. Example: \"which button opens drawer?\" Even commander/follower\n 'RequestForInstruction', # Category: Instruction. Example: \"what should I do today?\" Almost entirely follower\n 'RequestForObjectLocationAndOtherDetails', # Category: Object/Location. Example: \"where is the mug?\" Almost entirely follower\n 'RequestMore', # Category: Instruction. Example: \"Is there anything else to do?\" Almost entirely follower\n 'RequestOtherInfo' # Category: Instruction. Example: \"how many slices of tomato?\" Almost entirely follower\n]\n\n\n\nYour job is to respond to a given dialogue/action history with only one Dialogue act or OBSERVE.\nEither return the dialogue act, or return the OBSERVE action. Return only one word/phrase.\n\n\nGoal: Serve 3 slice(s) of Lettuce on a Plate.\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: hi, what should I do first? <<Greetings/Salutations,RequestForInstruction>>\nCOMMANDER: We need to serve 3 slices of lettuce on a plate <<Instruction>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: Could you find lettuce first? <<Instruction>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: yes, where do I place it? <<Affirm,RequestOtherInfo>>\nCOMMANDER: find knife <<Instruction>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <pickup ButterKnife>\nCOMMANDER: Knife is near the lettuce <<InformationOnObjectDetails>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: Please turn back <<Instruction>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <putdown CounterTop>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <pickup ButterKnife>\nCOMMANDER: it's on opposite side <<InformationOnObjectDetails>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: can I slice it? <<Confirm>>\nCOMMANDER: yes <<Affirm>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <slice Lettuce>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: what next? <<RequestForInstruction>>\nCOMMANDER: open the cabinet and find plate <<Instruction>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <open Cabinet>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <open Cabinet>\nCOMMANDER: the cabinet is on the right of fridge <<InformationOnObjectDetails>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: open middle cabinet door on top <<Instruction>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <putdown CounterTop>\nCOMMANDER: Could you find it? <<Confirm>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: I cant open the doors <<NotifyFailure>>\nCOMMANDER: go right of fridge <<Instruction>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: Open the cabinet exactly on top of lettuce <<Instruction>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: Go close to the doors <<Instruction>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: one step right <<Instruction>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: I am trying to interact with the cabinet <<NotifyFailure>>\nCOMMANDER: go close to the cabinet <<Instruction>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <open Cabinet>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <close Cabinet>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <open Cabinet>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <pickup Plate>\nCOMMANDER: Place it somewhere <<Instruction>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: Place it on middle <<Instruction>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <putdown CounterTop>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: i was only able to place it there <<Acknowledge>>\nCOMMANDER: No problem <<FeedbackPositive>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <pickup Lettuce>\nCOMMANDER: Place lettuces on plate <<Instruction>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <putdown Plate>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: what else? <<RequestForInstruction>>\nCOMMANDER: we need get remaining2 lettuces <<Instruction>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: are there more plates to place them? <<RequestOtherInfo>>\nCOMMANDER: open fridge and get lettuce <<Instruction>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: or you can take lettuce which are lying there <<Instruction>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: slice them and place it on the same plate <<Instruction>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <open Fridge>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <pickup Lettuce>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <putdown CounterTop>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <close Fridge>\nCOMMANDER: beside fridge 2 lettuces are there <<InformationOnObjectDetails>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: slice them and place it on plate <<Instruction>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <pickup ButterKnife>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <putdown CounterTop>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <pickup ButterKnife>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <slice Lettuce>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <slice Lettuce>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <putdown CounterTop>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <pickup Lettuce>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <putdown Plate>\nCOMMANDER: Do the same with third one <<Instruction>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <pickup Lettuce>\nCOMMANDER response:",
