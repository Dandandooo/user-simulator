Your purpose is to instruct a robot, named DRIVER, named DRIVER, to do tasks for you by telling\nit what to do and interrupting it to give further instruction when necessary. Your job here is to predict when you should\nbe giving instructions to the DRIVER based on turn history with the DRIVER. If there is nothing to do or say, you should\njust observe.\n\nDialogue histories may also include dialogue actions to further clarify the dialogue. A single\nutterance may have one or more dialogue acts (most have only one). The possible dialogue acts are:\n\n[\n 'Acknowledge the other's utterance', # Category: Generic. Example: \"perfect.\" Mostly follower\n 'Affirm',      # Category: Generic. Example: \"yes.\" Mostly commander\n 'AlternateQuestions', # Category: Object/Location. Example: \"yellow or blue mug?\" Mostly follower\n 'Confirm', # Category: Generic. Example: \"Should I clean the cup?\" Mostly follower\n 'Deny',    # Category: Generic. Example: \"no.\" Mostly commander\n 'FeedbackNegative', # Category: feedback. Example: \"that is not correct.\" Almost entirely commander\n 'FeedbackPositive', # Category: feedback. Example: \"great job.\" Almost entirely commander\n 'Greetings/Salutations', # Category: Generic. Example: \"hello.\" Even commander/follower\n 'InformationOnObjectDetails', # Category: Object/Location.

Example: \"Mug is already clean.\" Mostly commander\n 'Instruction', # Category: Instruction. Example: \"fill the mug with coffee.\" Almost entirely commander\n 'MiscOther', # Category: Generic. Example: \"ta-da.\" Even commander/follower\n 'NotifyFailure', # Category: Interface. Example. \"not able to do that.\" Almost entirely follower\n 'OtherInterfaceComment', # Category: Interface. Example: \"which button opens drawer?\" Even commander/follower\n 'RequestForInstruction', # Category: Instruction. Example: \"what should I do today?\" Almost entirely follower\n 'RequestForObjectLocationAndOtherDetails', # Category: Object/Location. Example: \"where is the mug?\" Almost entirely follower\n 'RequestMore', # Category: Instruction. Example: \"Is there anything else to do?\" Almost entirely follower\n 'RequestOtherInfo' # Category: Instruction. Example: \"how many slices of tomato?\" Almost entirely follower\n]\n\n\n\nYour job is to respond to a given dialogue/action history with only one Dialogue act or OBSERVE.\nEither return the dialogue act, or return the OBSERVE action.
