Your purpose is to instruct a robot, named DRIVER, to do tasks for\nyou by telling it what to do and interrupting it to give further instruction when necessary. Your job here is to predict when\nyou should be giving instructions to the DRIVER based on turn history with the DRIVER. If there is nothing to do or say, you\nshould just observe.\n\nDialogue histories may also include dialogue actions to further clarify the dialogue. A single\nutterance may have one or more dialogue acts (most have only one). The possible dialogue acts are:\n\n[\n 'Acknowledge the other's utterance', # Category: Generic. Example: \"perfect.\" Mostly follower\n 'Affirm',      # Category: Generic. Example: \"yes.\" Mostly commander\n 'AlternateQuestions', # Category: Object/Location. Example: \"yellow or blue mug?\" Mostly follower\n 'Confirm', # Category: Generic. Example: \"Should I clean the cup?\" Mostly follower\n 'Deny',    # Category: Generic. Example: \"no.\" Mostly commander\n 'FeedbackNegative', # Category: feedback. Example: \"that is not correct.\" Almost entirely commander\n 'FeedbackPositive', # Category: feedback. Example: \"great job.\" Almost entirely commander\n 'Greetings/Salutations', # Category: Generic. Example: \"hello.\" Even commander/follower\n 'InformationOnObjectDetails', # Category: Object/Location. Example: \"knife is behind the sink.\" Almost entirely commander\n 'InformationOther', # Category: Generic. Example: \"Mug is already clean.\" Mostly commander\n 'Instruction', # Category: Instruction. Example: \"fill the mug with coffee.\" Almost entirely commander\n 'MiscOther', # Category: Generic. Example: \"ta-da.\" Even commander/follower\n 'NotifyFailure', # Category: Interface. Example. \"not able to do that.\" Almost entirely follower\n 'OtherInterfaceComment', # Category: Interface. Example: \"which button opens drawer?\" Even commander/follower\n 'RequestForInstruction', # Category: Instruction. Example: \"what should I do today?\" Almost entirely follower\n 'RequestForObjectLocationAndOtherDetails', # Category: Object/Location. Example: \"where is the mug?\" Almost entirely follower\n 'RequestMore', # Category: Instruction. Example: \"Is there anything else to do?\" Almost entirely follower\n 'RequestOtherInfo' # Category: Instruction. Example: \"how many slices of tomato?\" Almost entirely follower\n]\n\nExample :\nGoal: Prepare coffee in a clean mug.\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: How can I help? <<RequestForInstruction>>\nCOMMANDER: Please fill a mug with coffee <<Instruction>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: There is a clean mug next to the tove top <<InformationOnObjectDetails>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: stove* <<InformationOnObjectDetails>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <pickup Mug>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <putdown CoffeeMachine>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <toggle on CoffeeMachine>\nCOMMANDER response:\nOBSERVE\n\nExample :\nGoal: Cook 3 slice(s) of Potato and serve in a Bowl.\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: hi how can i be of assistance <<Greetings/Salutations,RequestForInstruction>>\nCOMMANDER response:\nGreetings/Salutations\n\nExample :\nGoal: Cook 2 slice(s) of Potato and serve in a Bowl.\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: how can I help? <<RequestForInstruction>>\nCOMMANDER response:\nInstruction\n\nExample :\nGoal: Make a plate of toast.\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: Hi.
