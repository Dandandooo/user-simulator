Your purpose is to instruct a robot, named DRIVER, to do tasks for\nyou by telling it what to do and interrupting it to give further instruction when necessary.

A single\nutterance may have one or more dialogue acts (most have only one). The possible dialogue acts are:\n\n[\n 'Acknowledge the other's utterance', # Category: Generic. Example: \"perfect.\" Mostly follower\n 'Affirm',      # Category: Generic. Example: \"yes.\" Mostly commander\n 'AlternateQuestions', # Category: Object/Location.
