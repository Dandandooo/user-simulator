Your purpose is to instruct a robot, named DRIVER, named DRIVER, to do tasks for you by telling\nit what to do and interrupting it to give further instruction when necessary. Your job here is to predict when you should\nbe giving instructions to the DRIVER based on turn history with the DRIVER. If there is nothing to do or say, you should\njust observe.\n\nDialogue histories may also include dialogue actions to further clarify the dialogue. A single\nutterance may have one or more dialogue acts (most have only one). The possible dialogue acts are:\n\n[\n 'Acknowledge the other's utterance', # Category: Generic. Example: \"perfect.\" Mostly follower\n 'Affirm',      # Category: Generic. Example: \"yes.\" Mostly commander\n 'AlternateQuestions', # Category: Object/Location. Example: \"yellow or blue mug?\" Mostly follower\n 'Confirm', # Category: Generic. Example: \"Should I clean the cup?\" Mostly follower\n 'Deny',    # Category: Generic. Example: \"no.\" Mostly commander\n 'FeedbackNegative', # Category: feedback. Example: \"that is not correct.\" Almost entirely commander\n 'FeedbackPositive', # Category: feedback. Example: \"great job.\" Almost entirely commander\n 'Greetings/Salutations', # Category: Generic. Example: \"hello.\" Even commander/follower\n 'InformationOnObjectDetails', # Category: Object/Location. Example: \"knife is behind the sink.\" Almost entirely commander\n 'InformationOther', # Category: Generic. Example: \"Mug is already clean.\" Mostly commander\n 'Instruction', # Category: Instruction. Example: \"fill the mug with coffee.\" Almost entirely commander\n 'MiscOther', # Category: Generic. Example: \"ta-da.\" Even commander/follower\n 'NotifyFailure', # Category: Interface. Example. \"not able to do that.\" Almost entirely follower\n 'OtherInterfaceComment', # Category: Interface. Example: \"which button opens drawer?\" Even commander/follower\n 'RequestForInstruction', # Category: Instruction. Example: \"what should I do today?\" Almost entirely follower\n 'RequestForObjectLocationAndOtherDetails', # Category: Object/Location. Example: \"where is the mug?\" Almost entirely follower\n 'RequestMore', # Category: Instruction. Example: \"Is there anything else to do?\" Almost entirely follower\n 'RequestOtherInfo' # Category: Instruction. Example: \"how many slices of tomato?\" Almost entirely follower\n]\n\nExample :\nGoal: Boil Potato.\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: hi how can i help <<Greetings/Salutations,RequestForInstruction>>\nCOMMANDER response:\nGreetings/Salutations\n\nExample :\nGoal: Water the plant.\n\nCOMMANDER response:\nInstruction\n\nExample :\nGoal: Put all RemoteControl on one Chairs.\nCOMMANDER: hi <<Greetings/Salutations>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: what shall I do today/? <<RequestForInstruction>>\nCOMMANDER: place remote on single chair <<Instruction>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER response:\nOBSERVE\n\nExample :\nGoal: Put all TissueBox on one SideTable.\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: what would you like me to do? <<RequestForInstruction>>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <move>\nCOMMANDER: grab the tissuebox and put it on the side table <<Instruction>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER response:\nOBSERVE\n\nExample :\nGoal: Clean all the Bowls.\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: What shall I do today? <<RequestForInstruction>>\nCOMMANDER: we need to clean all the bowls <<Instruction>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <move>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <pickup Pot>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <move>\nCOMMANDER response:\nInformationOnObjectDetails\n\nYour job is to respond to a given dialogue/action history with only one Dialogue act or OBSERVE.\nEither return the dialogue act, or return the OBSERVE action. Return only one word/phrase.\n\n\nGoal: Put all Watch on one Chairs.\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: What should I do today? <<RequestForInstruction>>\nCOMMANDER: Put the watch on a chair <<InformationOnObjectDetails>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <move>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: Where is the watch? <<RequestForObjectLocationAndOtherDetails>>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <move>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <open Drawer>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <move>\nCOMMANDER: The watch is inside the black drawer to the left of the brown couch <<InformationOnObjectDetails>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <close Drawer>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <move>\nCOMMANDER: There is also a watch on the small red seat at the corner <<InformationOnObjectDetails>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: The right of the couch sorry <<InformationOnObjectDetails>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <move>\nCOMMANDER: Open that drawer and remove the watch <<Instruction>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <pickup Watch>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <move>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <putdown ArmChair>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <move>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <pickup Watch>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <putdown Chair>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: Is that correct? <<Confirm>>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <move>\nCOMMANDER: Pick the watch on the red chair and place it on the black couch <<Instruction>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <pickup Watch>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <move>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <putdown ArmChair>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: Anything else? <<RequestMore>>\nCOMMANDER response:",
