If there is nothing to do or say, you should\njust observe.\n\nDialogue histories may also include dialogue actions to further clarify the dialogue. A single\nutterance may have one or more dialogue acts (most have only one). The possible dialogue acts are:\n\n[\n 'Acknowledge the other's utterance', # Category: Generic. Example: \"perfect.\" Mostly follower\n 'Affirm',      # Category: Generic. Example: \"yes.\" Mostly commander\n 'AlternateQuestions', # Category: Object/Location. Example: \"yellow or blue mug?\" Mostly follower\n 'Confirm', # Category: Generic. Example: \"Should I clean the cup?\" Mostly follower\n 'Deny',    # Category: Generic. Example: \"no.\" Mostly commander\n 'FeedbackNegative', # Category: feedback. Example: \"that is not correct.\" Almost entirely commander\n 'FeedbackPositive', # Category: feedback. Example: \"great job.\" Almost entirely commander\n 'Greetings/Salutations', # Category: Generic. Example: \"hello.\" Even commander/follower\n 'InformationOnObjectDetails', # Category: Object/Location. Example: \"knife is behind the sink.\" Almost entirely commander\n 'InformationOther', # Category: Generic. Example: \"Mug is already clean.\" Mostly commander\n 'Instruction', # Category: Instruction. Example: \"fill the mug with coffee.\" Almost entirely commander\n 'MiscOther', # Category: Generic. Example: \"ta-da.\" Even commander/follower\n 'NotifyFailure', # Category: Interface. Example. \"not able to do that.\" Almost entirely follower\n 'OtherInterfaceComment', # Category: Interface. Example: \"which button opens drawer?\" Even commander/follower\n 'RequestForInstruction', # Category: Instruction. Example: \"what should I do today?\" Almost entirely follower\n 'RequestForObjectLocationAndOtherDetails', # Category: Object/Location. Example: \"where is the mug?\" Almost entirely follower\n 'RequestMore', # Category: Instruction. Example: \"Is there anything else to do?\" Almost entirely follower\n 'RequestOtherInfo' # Category: Instruction. Example: \"how many slices of tomato?\" Almost entirely follower\n]\n\nExample :\nGoal: Put all Bread in any Cabinet.\nCOMMANDER: hi all the bread needs to be placed in a cabinet <<Greetings/Salutations,Instruction>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <move>\nCOMMANDER: there should be bread in the fridge <<InformationOnObjectDetails>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <move>\nCOMMANDER: and another on the counter next to the fridge <<InformationOnObjectDetails>>\nDRIVER: <observe>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <open Fridge>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <move>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <pickup Bread>\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: <move>\nCOMMANDER response:\nOBSERVE\n\nExample :\nGoal: Put all DishSponge in any Sink.\nCOMMANDER: <observe>\nDRIVER: hello.
