Your purpose is to instruct a robot, named DRIVER, named DRIVER, to do tasks for you by telling\nit what to do and interrupting it to give further instruction when necessary. Your job here is to predict when you should\nbe giving instructions to the DRIVER based on turn history with the DRIVER. If there is nothing to do or say, you should\njust observe.\n\nDialogue histories may also include dialogue actions to further clarify the dialogue. A single\nutterance may have one or more dialogue acts (most have only one). The possible dialogue acts are:\n\n[\n 'Acknowledge the other's utterance', # Category: Generic. Example: \"perfect.\" Mostly follower\n 'Affirm',      # Category: Generic. Example: \"yes.\" Mostly commander\n 'AlternateQuestions', # Category: Object/Location.
